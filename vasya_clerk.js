/*The new "Avengers" movie has just been released! There are a lot of people at the cinema box office standing in a huge line. Each of them has a single 100, 50 or 25 dollar bill. An "Avengers" ticket costs 25 dollars.

Vasya is currently working as a clerk. He wants to sell a ticket to every single person in this line.

Can Vasya sell a ticket to every person and give change if he initially has no money and sells the tickets strictly in the order people queue?

Return YES, if Vasya can sell a ticket to every person and give change with the bills he has at hand at that moment. Otherwise return NO.

Examples:

tickets([25, 25, 50]) // => YES 
tickets([25, 100]) // => NO. Vasya will not have enough money to give change to 100 dollars
tickets([25, 25, 50, 50, 100]) // => NO. Vasya will not have the right bills to give 75 dollars of change (you can't make two bills of 25 from one of 50)*/


function tickets(peopleInLine){
  let count25 = 0;
  let count50 = 0;
  let count100 = 0;
  for(let i = 0; i<peopleInLine.length; i++){
    if(peopleInLine[i] === 25)
      count25++;
    if(peopleInLine[i] === 50){
      if(count25 > 0){
      count25--;
        count50++;
        }
      else
        {
          return "NO";
        }
      }
    if(peopleInLine[i] === 100){
      if(count25 >= 3 && count50 == 0){
        count25 = count25 - 3;
        count100++;
      }
      else if(count25 >=1 && count50 >=1){
        count50--;
        count25--;
        count100++;
      }
